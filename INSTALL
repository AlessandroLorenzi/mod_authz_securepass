Now we have to install mod_authz_securepass. There isn't yet a 
ready to use package avaiable, but compile it is really simple.
We need apxs (APache eXtenSion tool) usually provided with the
development package of Apache.

For Debian-like distro install it with

apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev 
# or
apt-get install apache2-threaded-dev

or with RedHat

yum install httpd-devel

Now download the source from git from the stable branch

git clone https://github.com/AlessandroLorenzi/mod_authz_securepass.git -b master
cd mod_authz_securepass

The following code will compile and install the module

make install_redhat

or in debian distro:

make install_debian
a2enmod securepass

Configuring mod_auth_securepass

First we need to configure Apache to use cas. Follow the guide:
http://support.secure-pass.net/wiki/index.php/Apache

Is bossible to configure SecurePass module into .htaccess

<Location />
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
    AuthzSecurepass On
    AuthType CAS
    AuthName "private area"
    Require sprealm garl.ch partner.it
<Location>

In this example both user@garl.ch and otheruser@partner.it
are allowed to access into site.

Take care to activate module

    AuthzSecurepass On

and set allowed realms

    Require sprealm garl.ch partner.it

Done!
